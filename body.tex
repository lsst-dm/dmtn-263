\section{Introduction}
We are required to publish the observing schedule and choose ObsLocTap\footnote{\url{documents/ObsLocTap}} as the protocol.

\section{Requirements}

\citeds{LSE-30} (OSS) requires publication at least two hours ahead of observing.

In \citeds{DMTN-199} the agencies insist we publish a schedule 24 hours ahead of observing.
The lack of fidelity of such a schedule is acknowledged by the agencies.

As I read this there is an immediate issue - the scheduler puts out a record and the system reacts always to the the latest record.
At 24 hours before we would at the start of the observing night need to have the current schedule \emph{and another for the next night}.
Or the schedule should always be 24 hours with a big gap for day time.
